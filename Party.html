    <div class="A"> Hello everyone and this is the GradDTAKing, welcome to my noun project and this noun project is on party. Let me explain more about partying and why it is important. For the party, it is mostly an event or a contest to get everyguests and visitors gathered around to enjoy the fresh music and the relaxing and refreshing dances. Many people like to party, because they are feeling bored with nothing to do or getting frustrated when they had things that were difficult. Parties are celebrated in many different ways and they are Birthdays, Dance, DJ, banquets, alcoholic, proms, and bachelor ones. One thing that I learned about party is that it is an event that invites guests and welsomes everyone to enjoy the refreshing and powerful beat of music. Ther are not a lot of people party all day and all night, because they have to focus on the works, doing many chorus like cleaning the yard, and being pulled to other events in other places. What if we think that we all partied for a month without stopping. This can led to health problems. They can be held in many places such as parks and other places that are right for them to be. here's what you all know about what party is and how partying can be. </div>
