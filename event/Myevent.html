    <h1> Hiking Trail </h1>
  <p> Hello friends and this is Dennis Wang speaking to you guys. Welcome to the event at the Gonzalez Canyon and it is going to be the Hiking Trail. During the event, we will be hiking to the lake and to the Town of Good Hope. Feel the fresh air and the wind floating around you. Enjoy the sounds of brid chirping and animal sounds as you pass by. Too much fresh air is not a bad thing and hike more, worry less about stress. Do not pick up plants from the wildlife. Always leave the wildlife along as you pass by. We do not allow any drugs, smoking, or chewing gum. Be sure to look out for your pets, infants, or toddlers and protect them from danger and hazard places. Bye and see you next time! Stay safe and have fun. </p>
